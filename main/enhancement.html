    <h1>Progressive Enhancement</h1>
    <h2>progressive enhancement: </h2>
<p> a way of thinking about web design and development that puts content, not code, first to create a more inclusive end result.  With this way of thinking, a robust, thoughtfully developed webpage can still get its point across and the user can achieve their goal, no matter how the user chooses to load the content. With progressive enhancement, the foundation of the page is rich, semantically meaningful HTML. Each additional layer, the CSS and then the JavaScript,  only builds on and enhances the user's experience.  This method puts the content first instead of the design, and holds up the clear separation between content, design, and presentation recommended by the W3C. </p>

<h2>my thoughts: </h2>
<p>I think this is a really important concept and kind of wish I'd heard of  it sooner! While it doesn't really change the way I think about my own development workflow, it does provide a very useful shorthand for talking about how to think about and design web projects. It also provides a great jumping-off point to do more research! I have a particular interest in web accessibility, and the concept of progressive enhancement ties perfectly into this interest. </p>

<p>I read through  <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/ruininguserexperience/">this blog post </a> comparing the web experience to that of a restaurant and found that analogy to be quite compelling.  While it was written in 2007, many of its points still ring true in 2020. A content and markup-first strategy ensures that users can go about their experience however they please. And man, did those screenshots bring back hidden memories of my first forays into the mobile web on a slider phone.  ( I would've been ELEVEN then, oh my gosh. An actual child. I think I got my own phone in 2008 or early 2009? )</p>
