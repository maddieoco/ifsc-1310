    <p>-I  used illustrator. Tried Gravit, didn't love it, I'm paying for CC anyway, might as well use it.</p> 
<p>-I wanted to make my own version of the tutorial assignment, but with my own twists. I did not like the finished look of the tutorial project-it looked professional, but cheesy in a way I can't properly describe. I think the purple background and the font, combined with the drop shadows everywhere made it look super cheap. Unfortunately, I'm a designer at heart and cannot stand to put my name on things that I don't love. </p>
<p> I distilled the tutorial into a few key points:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use of multiple colors and transparency to achieve a "rainbow" effect</li>
    <li> A shape within a shape created with clipping masks</li>
    <li> Using filters and layer styles to create the illusion of depth</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, this was really fun! I got to dive into some menus I'd never touched before and am happy with the result. It might have gotten a little too complicated, but that's just how it goes. I did end up going back to Gravit to work with it a little more and found that it's a great tool, just not when you expect it to behave like Illustrator.</p>
