    <h1> Dragon Micro Site Version 2</h1>
    
    <p> Version 1 was relatively rough. I had some issues troubleshooting my CSS and getting the three-column flexbox element to play nicely. I got some largely unhelpful feedback from friends and family and decided to start with those issues first:</p>
    <blockquote> "Well you're missing the meta tag for zooming on mobile so I can't read it on my phone. Other than that it's fine, I guess?"<cite>--Vicky Pearce, best friend and web developer</cite></blockquote>
    <blockquote> "It's kind of busy." <cite> --Sherry O'Connor, mom and former print layout editor</cite></blockquote>
    <blockquote> "It's amazing!" <cite>--Michael O'Connor, dad and software architect  </cite> </blockquote>
    <h2> The Rework</h2>
    <p> The feedback I chose to actually listen to was my mom's comment that it was busy. She only looked at the main page which had the most going on, but I'd shared her concern especially regarding readability. What I ended up doing was moving some of the relevant content out to the FAQ and history pages to streamline the main page and put the focus on the images and text. It is still absolutely not a minimal design by any stretch of the imagination, but I really wanted to play with color in ways I hadn't tried before. I also was reacting a little to the official SpaceX site, which is beautiful but completely devoid of any kind of inspiration in design.  </p>
    <h2> Regrets </h2>
    <p> I got really bogged down in the design, being a designer, and even though I went to a lot of trouble to start with a plan of what I wanted, I kept changing my mind about either how to implement it or how I wanted it to look. Or I'd encounter a problem and fling myself into a rabbit hole of potential and only tangentially related solutions. I still feel like I'm not very good yet at troubleshooting my own code without getting really confused. I also don't yet have a solid understanding of how much I don't know. </p>
    <h2> Moving Forward</h2>
    <p> If I were to do this over, I'd stick to my plan and work all the way through it before making changes to something that wasn't even done yet. I would also write clearer comments in my CSS to help myself keep track of what exactly I was INTENDING the code to do, because over the course of a few weeks I completely forgot what I was trying to do and ended up writing a lot of extra code and a bunch of conflicting rules. That was probably the thing that slowed me down the most.</p>
    <p> I really enjoyed working on this, given that I've never actually done this from scratch. Like anything else, there's a lot that I'd do differently if I had to do it again, but overall I'm pretty pleased with the effort. </p>
