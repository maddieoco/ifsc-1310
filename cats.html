          <h2> Introduction </h2>  
          <p>We have <em> too many cats. </em> More precisely, we have four. It’s not an experience I’d recommend, and<strong> I love all of our cats!</strong> I have two cats, Dapper and Monty. The other two cats belong to my aunt Brenda. The four cats haven’t always lived together, though.</p>
          <p> Until March of 2020, my two cats lived with me in Kansas City, Missouri. Brenda and her two cats lived with my parents in North Little Rock, and then I moved south and joined them when COVID turned my life upside down as my lease was ending.</p>

<h2>The KC Cats </h2>
<h3>Dapper</h3>
Dapper is a creature that can best be described as <q> quirky. </q> Weighing at just under six pounds and well past his sixth birthday, he is not a large guy. I adopted Dapper in October 2016. 
<ul>
<h4>Some of Dapper’s favorite things: </h4>
<li> Piles of pillows </li>
<li> Deleting documents while I work on them </li>
<li> Meowing at the washing machine </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>“MEOW! MEOW MEOW! RRRRROwwwOOW!”<cite> -Dapper D. G. O’Connor, 2020</cite></blockquote>
<h3>Monty </h3>
Monty is the baby of the family, only recently having turned one in July, He’s full of energy and too smart for his own good. He learns quickly and has a relentless appetite for destruction. This is not a good combination. Monty is possibly the prettiest cat I’ve ever met, and he knows it. Long hair, big blue eyes, and little white socks make for one adorable cat. Monty was adopted in October of 2019. 

<h4>Monty’s Skills </h4>
<ul>
<li>Shredding anything made of paper that he can find </li>
<li>Playing fetch</li>
<li>Coming when called </li>
<li>Sitting very politely for photos </li>
<li> Problem solving (used to commit cat crimes) </li>
</ul>

<h2> Cats Of Texas Origin </h2>
<h3> Widget </h3>
<p>There’s no question that Widget is the guy with the best manners of the three boy cats. Widget was found by my cousin Drew behind a dumpster somewhere in Fort Worth, but you’d never know it. Widget is large, orange, and just wants to find a nice spot to sit. He enjoys observing life as it passes him by, sitting on computers, and will do anything for wet cat food. When the weather is nice, Widget thinks he’d like to be an outdoor cat. (No one else in the house agrees with him on this.) </p>
<h3> Flavia </h3>
<p> Flavia is the reigning queen empress of all cats and humans in her domain. She insists that all other living creatures comply with her wishes, and is extremely willing to use lethal force to enforce compliance. I have the scars to prove it. She is a loyal and dedicated companion, if you happen to be my aunt Brenda. She merely tolerates everyone else. If Flavia thinks she’s been slighted somehow or that another cat is in her way, she will initiate a high-speed chase until the other cat backs down or she has them cornered. She also loves human hair and might have been a hairstylist in a past life.

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p> As noted above, each individual cat has strengths and weaknesses. Dapper is the smallest cat by far but manages to make as much noise as the rest of the cats put together. Flavia is very smart but loses marks on friendliness because she likes to bite me. Monty is very smart and has a lot of energy, but unfortunately uses this to create chaos and attempt to beat up Widget. Dapper loses friendliness points because he's afraid of most household appliances and spends a lot of his time hiding.</p>
