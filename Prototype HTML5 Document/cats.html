          <h2> Introduction </h2>  
          <p>We have <em> too many cats. </em> More precisely, we have four. It’s not an experience I’d recommend, and<strong> I love all of our cats!</strong> I have two cats, Dapper and Monty. The other two cats belong to my aunt Brenda. The four cats haven’t always lived together, though.</p>
          <p> Until March of 2020, my two cats lived with me in Kansas City, Missouri. Brenda and her two cats lived with my parents in North Little Rock, and then I moved south and joined them when COVID turned my life upside down as my lease was ending. </p>

<h2>The KC Cats </h2>
<h3>Dapper</h3>
Dapper is a creature that can best be described as <q> quirky. </q> Weighing at just under six pounds and well past his sixth birthday, he is not a large guy. I adopted Dapper in October 2016. 
<ul>
<h4>Some of Dapper’s favorite things: </h4>
<li> Piles of pillows </li>
<li> Deleting documents while I work on them </li>
<li> Meowing at the washing machine </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>“MEOW! MEOW MEOW! RRRRROwwwOOW!”<cite> -Dapper D. G. O’Connor, 2020</cite></blockquote>
<h3>Monty </h3>
Monty is the baby of the family, only recently having turned one in July, He’s full of energy and too smart for his own good. He learns quickly and has a relentless appetite for destruction. This is not a good combination. Monty is possibly the prettiest cat I’ve ever met, and he knows it. Long hair, big blue eyes, and little white socks make for one adorable cat. Monty was adopted in October of 2019. 
<ul>
<h4>Monty’s Skills </h4>
<li>Shredding anything made of paper that he can find </li>
<li>Playing fetch</li>
<li>Coming when called </li>
<li>Sitting very politely for photos </li>
<li> Problem solving (used to commit cat crimes) </li>
</ul>
